## The math

Members of set X:

    A = oneself
    B = person one is interacting with
    C = set of people not present in the interaction

Sentence/structure:

    X inferring X's value from X's judgement that X has value for X

Assuming that the sentence/structure I'm using is appropriate (likely there are alternatives, some may be better), then we care about allowing for repetitions and there are 3 members and 5 slots to fill: 3^5=243 permutations.

But the form we are really concerned with—that already have two first slots filled in—is:

    B inferring A's value from X's judgement that X has value for X

Now it's 3 members and 3 slots: 3^3=27 permutations.

But then we can allow for metajudgements in the sentence/structure which adds another slot:

    B inferring A's value from X's judgement that X will make the judgement that X has value for X

Now it's 3 members and 4 slots: 3^4=81 permutations.

Then we can allow for conjugations that can be placed at different places, three examples:

    B inferring A's value from X's judgement that X will make the judgement that X has value for X & X
    B inferring A's value from X's judgement that X & X will make the judgement that X has value for X
    B inferring A's value from X's & X's judgement that X will make the judgement that X has value for X

Assuming we only add one conjugation we are back where we started with 3 members and 5 slots: 3^5=243 permutations.

But we still have the other permutations from the previous sentences/structures, so 27+81+243=351.

## Reference

Here are the ones from Anthony's third VM on 24/04/23 in chronological order:

    B inferring A's value from C's judgement that A has value for C
    B inferring A's value from A's judgement that A has value for B
    B inferring A's value from A's judgement that C will make the judgement that A has value for C & B
    B inferring A's value from C's judgement that A has value for B

## Conclusion

I can’t think of a method to figure which ones are commonly occurring in social situations other than to manually check each one. But obviously many are not relevant… such as the permutation with A in all slots (then it’s not even a social situation since only oneself is involved)... or those permutations where slots are only filled with B and C (then oneself is not involved in the social situation). How many others are irrelevant and how do we eliminate them?

Eliminating all irrelevant permutations and identifying all relevant permutations are surely not a very important thing to do. I think the takeaway is just that how we infer value is complicated. So complicated that when modelling it there’s a tradeoff between an accurate model and a useful/memorizable model. We could even model even more variables. For example by breaking down the set C into its members and weighting these members’ judgements according to how much B trusts them. Or by allowing for conditionals in the inferences/judgements. So there’s no end to it. But it's also overkill.

Even the math I did above is overkill. The way to deal with it in practice is just to be aware of the inferences and judgements people are making in the moment. We have a big brain evolved for these calculations after all. Knowing that this is a thing we can bring these calculations to awareness and hack the social interactions. We could potentially simplify the math/permutations/model from above, but right now I can't think of an obvious way to do this.
